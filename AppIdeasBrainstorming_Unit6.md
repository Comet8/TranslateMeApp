App Ideas Brainstorming

APP IDEA 1: TripTrove

What: App for finding, saving & sharing your favorite spots. Users can curate places under categories such as Eat, Shop, Stay, and Culture. Users can follow each other to see other's recommendations on a map showing the location of the spots as pinpoints that one can select to see more information about the place and add it to their profile as well. 

Who: Travel enthusiasts that want to get personalized recommendations and social/community-oriented users that may want to explore their own area, share experiences, and follow reccomendations from friends and influencers. 

Why: To introduce people to new experiences and help them discover new places. We are creating this app to provide users with easy to access, all in one place suggestions that can facilitate travel planning. 

Challenges: Data management of the user-generated data (logs, reviews, and photos) can be complex as users can log places all over the world and add their own photos to new spots they would like to add to their profile.
